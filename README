# üö¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a machine learning classification task that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using logistic regression. It uses the classic Titanic dataset, which contains data on passengers such as age, class, sex, and ticket fare.

## üìÇ Project Overview

The goal is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived or not based on relevant features.

- **Target Variable**: `Survived`  
- **Type**: Binary Classification  
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
